## Usage

python reddit.py
```

## To-Do

- [ ] Add functionality to automatically post all collected videos to YouTube with a timeline and description for each video. You will need to have a YouTube account, create a new project in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com), and obtain a `client_secret.json` file to authenticate with YouTube's API.
- [ ] Customize the description of the videos to include information from the original Reddit post, such as the title, upvotes, and post link.
- [x] Use `ffmpeg` to download and convert the video format to comply with YouTube's upload requirements.
- [ ] Schedule the script to run automatically on a regular basis using a task scheduler, such as [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (on Linux/Mac) or [Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page) (on Windows).
